# description
This project was a way for me to learn how webdevelopment works. It allowed me to experiment with:
* flask and jinja2 templating
* fun stuff with databases :D
* html, css and javascript
* deployment via:
    * docker build
    * pip environments

Website is just a simple website that lets you post and view letters.(skrivarabr√∏v) as we call them where i come from.
My goal was to write something beautiful with as little code as possible. Although this is still very much working progress.


### My plan is to include these extra features as time goes:
- [ ] styled page for each letter
- [ ] Letter verification via SMS and captcha
- [ ] scroll and load more content on frontpage
- [ ] picture compression to save some space
